# MusicPlayer-CodeAlpha
As an intern at CodeAlpha, I developed a responsive music player using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project features a sleek and modern user interface, with sections for "Popular Songs" and "Recently Played" tracks. Users can easily select and play songs from these lists, with the audio player displaying advanced controls.
